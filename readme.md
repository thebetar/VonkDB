# Introduction

After taking a Databases course during my master's studies, I got interested in how to make a basic database, so I took up this challenge.
I also wanted to use a programming language that I was unfamiliar with so I chose C++.

This database is a simple database written in C++ that uses CSV files with the `|` character as the primary separator. The database supports tables and columns. To keep the project small only basic operations are possible like getting data, writing data, removing data and updating data.
